# Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) - Suricata
> For this project im going to use Suricata, an open-source intrusion detection system, intrusion prevention system, and network analysis tool.

## Overview
There are three ways Suricata can be used: 
1. Intrusion detection system `(IDS)`
2. Intrusion prevention system `(IPS)`
3. Network security monitoring `(NSM)`
Here, I use it as an `IDS` and `NSM`.

## Examining alerts, logs and rules with Suricata 

In this scenario, I'm a security analyst who must monitor traffic on my employer's network. I’m required to configure Suricata and use it to trigger alerts.

Here’s how I did this task: First, I explored the custom rules in Suricata. Second, I ran Suricata with a custom rule in order to trigger it, and examine the output logs in the fast.log file. Finally, I examine the additional output that Suricata generates in the standard eve.json log file.

For the purposes of the tests I ran in this lab activity, I've created a sample.pcap file and a custom.rules file, which reside in the home folder.

Defining the files: 

1. The `sample.pcap` file is a packet capture file that contains an example of network traffic data, which I used to test the Suricata rules. This allowed me to simulate and repeat the exercise of monitoring network traffic.
  
2. The `custom.rules` file contains a custom rule when the lab activity starts. I added rules to this file and ran them against the network traffic data in the sample.pcap file.

3. The `fast.log` file will contain the alerts that Suricata generates. The fast.log file is empty when I begin the project. Each time I test a rule, or set of rules, against the sample network traffic data, Suricata adds a new alert line to the fast.log file when all the conditions in any of the rules are met. The fast.log file can be located in the /var/log/suricata directory after Suricata runs.

4. The `eve.json` file is the main, standard, and default log for events generated by Suricata. It contains detailed information about alerts triggered, as well as other network telemetry events, in JSON format. The eve.json file is generated when Suricate runs, and can also be located in the `/var/log/suricata` directory.


## Objectives

* Create custom rules and run them in Suricata
* Monitor traffic captured in a packet capture file
* Examine the `fast.log` and `eve.json` output

## Step-by-step 

1. Examining a custom rule in Suricata.

```
alert http $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg:"GET on wire"; flow:established,to_server; content:"GET"; http_method; sid:12345; rev:3;)
```

* Action
`Alert` : Instructs to alert on selected network traffic. Suricata will inspect the traffic packets and send out an alert in case it matches. 

* Header
`http`: The rule that applies is only to HTTP traffic. The arrow indicates the direction of the traffic from $HOME_NET and going to the destination IP address $EXTERNAL_NET. In this scenario, $HOME_NET is a suricata variable defined in `/etc/suricata/suricata/yaml` as a rule definitions.
$HOME_NET is definatd as the `172.21.224/0/20` subnet. 

* Rule options
`Rule`: Allows me to customize signatures with additional parameters.
  * The `msg`: The alert will print out the text `GET on wire`.
  * The `flow:established, to_server`: Determines that packet from the client to the server should be matched (The handshakes: SYN-ACK packet).
  * The `content`: "GET" tells Suricata to look for the word GET in the `http.method` of the packet.
  * The `sid:12345`: Unique numerical value that identify the rule.
  * The `rev:3` indicates the signature's version which is used to identify the signature's version.  

2. Triggering a custom rule in Suricata.
* First, I list the files in the `/var/log/suricata` folder using: `ls -l /var/log/suricata`. Upon carrying out this task, there will be no files to be found.

* I then run Suricata using the `custom.rules` and `sample.pcap`: `sudo suricata -r sample.pcap -S custom.rules -k none`.
  * The `-r sample.pcap` option specifies an input file to mimic network traffic. In this case, the sample.pcap file.
  * The `-S custom.rules` option instructs Suricata to use the rules defined in the custom.rules file.
  * The `-k none` option instructs Suricata to disable all checksum checks.

* Listing the files in the `/var/log/suricata` folder again: `ls -l /var/log/suricata`.

* Displaying `fast.log` using: `cat /var/log/suricata/fast.log`

![chrome_GCOEhLYHp9](https://github.com/Kwangsa19/Ketmanto-Cybersecurity-Portfolio/assets/135963482/52c12462-450d-4f66-bcdf-669236ab5e88)

Here, each line corresponds to an alert that was generated by Suricata when it processed a packet that met the conditions of an alert generating rule. Each line consists of the rule triggered the alert, source, destination and direction of the traffic. 


3. Examining `eve.json` output.
* I used the cat command to display the entries in the `eve.json` file: `cat /var/log/suricata/eve.json`.

* I then displayed the entries in an improved format: `jq . /var/log/suricata/eve/json | less`.

* Extracting specific event data from `eve.json` file using: `jq -c "[.timestamp,.flow_id,.alert.signature,.proto,.dest_ip]" /var/log/suricata/eve.json`.

4. Several things to be found in the `eve.json`:
  * The value of the severity for the first alert returned by the `jq` command is 3.
  * The destination IP address listed for the last event in the `eve.json` file is `142.250.1.102`.
  * The alert signature for the first entry in the `eve.json` is `GET on WIRE`.
